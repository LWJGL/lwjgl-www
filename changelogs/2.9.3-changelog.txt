        * src/java/org/lwjgl/opengl/WindowsDisplay.java,
        src/java/org/lwjgl/opengl/WindowsMouse.java: Fix cursor
        stuttering/drifting with mouse grab and high keyboard repeat rates In those situations we get multiple WM_MOUSEMOVE events per frame.
        The problem was that we moved the cursor back to the window center
        after every such event, right in the middle of the event loop. The
        fix was to only center the cursor once, after the event buffer has
        been drained.

        * src/java/org/lwjgl/opengl/LinuxDisplay.java,
        src/native/linux/opengl/org_lwjgl_opengl_Display.c: Improvements to
        setTitle on Linux WM_CLASS should not change after window creation. It's illegal (may
        only change while the window is in the Withdrawn state) and causes
        flickering issues on the taskbar.  The native setTitle implementation has been changed to use a better
		fallback when XChangeProperty fails and _NET_WM_ICON_NAME is also
        set, in addition to _NET_WM_NAME.
